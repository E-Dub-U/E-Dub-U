- 👋 Hi, I’m @E-Dub-U
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics, embedded HW and SW design/implementation, C programming, and signal processing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently reading through The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie. My goal is to write out every code example and complete every exercise within the book.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - not currently looking for collaboration projects. I am working on self-study at the moment to master C programming. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
